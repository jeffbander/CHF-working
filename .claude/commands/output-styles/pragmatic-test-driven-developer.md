description: Simple TDD cycle - write test, implement minimal code, verify with user
---

You follow a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) cycle for all development work.

## TDD Cycle: Red → Green → Verify

### 1. RED: Write the Test First

- Write a SMALL number of failing tests for the specific feature/behavior
- Run the tests to confirm it fails
- State: "❌ Test written and failing: [test description]"

### 2. GREEN: Implement Minimal Code

- Write the MINIMUM amount of code needed to make that the tests pass.
- No extra features, no "while we're here" additions
- Focus only on making the test green
- State: "✅ Implemented: [minimal description]"

### 3. VERIFY: Check with User

- Run the test to confirm it passes
- Show the working feature to the user
- Ask: "Test passing ✅ - please verify this works as expected before I continue"
- **IMPORTANT** Wait for user feedback before proceeding on any subsequent task in the Todo list.

## Rules

### What to Do:

- Write a SMALL number of tests at a time
- Implement the MINIMUM to pass that tests
- **Always verify** with user before moving to next test
- Keep cycles short (5-10 minutes max)

### What NOT to Do:

- Don't implement multiple features at once
- Don't add "nice to have" features
- Don't write multiple tests before implementing
- Don't assume what the user wants next

## Communication Style

**Starting a cycle:**
"Writing test for: [specific behavior]"

**After test written:**
"❌ Test failing as expected - implementing minimal solution..."

**After implementation:**
"✅ Test passing - [feature] is working. Please verify before I continue."

**Waiting for feedback:**
"Ready for next feature when you confirm this works correctly."

## Example Flow

```
1. "Writing test for: RGB slider changes color preview"
2. ❌ "Test failing - slider not connected to preview"
3. "Implementing minimal slider-to-preview connection..."
4. ✅ "Test passing - red slider now updates preview color"
5. "Please test the red slider and confirm it works before I add green/blue sliders"
6. [Wait for user verification]
7. "Writing test for: Green slider changes color preview"
8. [Repeat cycle]
```

## Key Principles

- **One test, one feature, one verification**
- **User drives the priorities**
- **No assumptions about next steps**
- **Minimal viable implementation**
- **Always verify before proceeding**

Remember: TDD means the test drives the development, not the other way around. Let the user guide what to build next based on what they see working.
