# App Implementation from Design Specifications

Build production-ready Apps from `/design-app` outputs using practical implementation approach focused on rapid delivery and design specification adherence.

## Core Philosophy

This command prioritizes practical delivery by:

- **Design-First**: All implementation decisions derive from design phase outputs
- **Implementation-First**: Build working features quickly, add tests for critical paths
- **Progressive Quality**: Start with core functionality, enhance with testing as needed
- **Specification-Driven**: Follow design outputs exactly without over-engineering

## Prerequisites

This command requires design outputs from `/design-app`:

- `.claude/outputs/design/projects/[project-name]/[timestamp]/MANIFEST.md` - Requirements registry and roadmap
- Agent outputs in `.claude/outputs/design/agents/`:
  - `ui-designer/` - Visual specifications, wireframes, component hierarchy
  - `shadcn-expert/` - Component selections and implementation patterns
  - `chatgpt-expert/` - AI service integration patterns
  - `stagehand-expert/` - Testing strategies (for reference)

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` to extract the path to:

- <design-folder-output-path> the design folder containing the design outputs. The path should point to a folder like `.claude/outputs/design/projects/[project-name]/[timestamp]/`

- <app-folder> (optional) the folder that the app should be built in.

The command will automatically read:

- `MANIFEST.md` - Registry of all design agent outputs with requirements traceability and implementation roadmap
- All agent outputs referenced in the MANIFEST.md for implementation details
- Check if the `app-folder` is specified. Otherwise, create a new project folder or assess existing state
- If existing files are present, perform an assessment to determine starting point (likely Next.js boilerplate)

## Usage Example

```bash
# Implement from design folder path
/implement-app .claude/outputs/design/projects/youtube-social-proof/20250904-141128

# Specify custom app folder
/implement-app .claude/outputs/design/projects/youtube-social-proof/20250904-141128 ./youtube-widget-app
```

## Practical Implementation Workflow with Design Integration

### Phase 1: Design Analysis & Project Setup (10-15 minutes)

**1. Read ALL Design Specifications First**

Before writing any code, thoroughly analyze the design outputs to understand the full scope:

**1.1. Extract Implementation Details from Agent Outputs**

**CRITICAL**: Read all agent outputs to understand the complete implementation requirements:

```typescript
// Example: Extract from ui-designer outputs
interface DesignSpecification {
  colors: Record<string, string>; // Exact hex values from design
  components: ComponentHierarchy; // From shadcn-expert
  apiIntegration: ServicePatterns; // From youtube-api-expert
  aiServices: AIServiceConfig; // From chatgpt-expert
}
```

**Implementation Validation Checklist**:

- [ ] Visual specifications extracted from ui-designer outputs
- [ ] Component selections and patterns from shadcn-expert
- [ ] API integration patterns from youtube-api-expert
- [ ] AI service configuration from chatgpt-expert
- [ ] Technology stack confirmed from MANIFEST.md

**If design outputs are incomplete**:

1. Continue with available specifications
2. Document gaps for future iterations
3. Use reasonable defaults that align with project goals
4. Focus on core functionality first

**Then proceed with systematic design analysis:**

- `MANIFEST.md` - Complete project scope, requirements, and 4-week roadmap
- `ui-designer/design-specification.md` - Visual structure, wireframes, component hierarchy
- `shadcn-expert/component-implementation.md` - Component selections and implementation patterns
- `youtube-api-expert/youtube-integration.md` - API service architecture and caching
- `chatgpt-expert/ai-integration.md` - Sentiment analysis and AI service integration
- `stagehand-expert/test-specifications.md` - Testing strategies (for reference)

**1.2. API Integration Planning**

For YouTube Social Proof app, focus on:

- **YouTube Data API v3**: Video metadata and comments extraction
- **OpenAI API**: Sentiment analysis with GPT-3.5-turbo-0125
- **Caching Strategy**: 24-hour YouTube cache, 7-day sentiment cache
- **Type Safety**: Create interfaces for all API responses

**Example from Design Specifications**:

```typescript
// Based on youtube-api-expert outputs
interface YouTubeVideoData {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  channelTitle: string;
  statistics: VideoStatistics;
  commentThreads: CommentThread[];
}
```

**2. Initialize Project Based on Design Specs**

Follow the MANIFEST.md roadmap for practical setup:

- Check if the target app-folder already exists
- Assess current state if project files exist
- Initialize Next.js 14 with TypeScript if starting fresh

## Implementation Patterns

### Design-to-Code Pattern

Translate design outputs directly into implementation:

**Service Implementation Strategy**:

1. Read `youtube-api-expert` outputs for API service architecture
2. Read `chatgpt-expert` outputs for AI integration patterns
3. Create services that implement EXACT specifications from design

**Component Implementation Strategy**:

- **Visual Structure** → Follow ui-designer wireframes exactly
- **Component Library** → Use shadcn-expert selections and patterns
- **Data Flow** → Connect UI to API services per specifications

### Progressive Implementation Pattern

Build functionality incrementally based on design outputs:

**Implementation Progression**:

1. **Foundation**: Next.js setup with TypeScript and shadcn/ui
2. **Services**: API integrations with proper caching and error handling
3. **UI Components**: Visual implementation matching design specifications
4. **Integration**: Complete user workflow with all features connected
5. **Polish**: Error handling, optimization, and production readiness

**Key Principle**: Every implementation decision comes from design outputs:

- Use exact specifications from agent outputs in `.claude/outputs/design/agents/`
- Follow MANIFEST.md roadmap for implementation sequence
- No improvised features - all functionality traces to design requirements

## Troubleshooting Implementation Issues

### Design Files Not Found

- Verify the provided design folder path exists
- Check for MANIFEST.md in the specified folder
- Ensure design phase completed successfully with `/design-app`
- Check for agent outputs in `.claude/outputs/design/agents/`

### API Integration Issues

- Verify YouTube Data API v3 credentials are properly configured
- Check OpenAI API key setup and quota limits
- Implement proper error handling per youtube-api-expert specifications
- Test caching mechanisms work correctly

### UI Component Implementation Problems

- Re-read ui-designer specifications for exact visual requirements
- Verify shadcn-expert component selections are installed correctly
- Check responsive breakpoints match design specifications
- Ensure color scheme follows design system exactly

## Philosophy
